This was put together from various sources of the int3rw3bz.
I remember g0tmi1k, some people at the top-hat-sec forum and some stuff was found via public pastebins.
Since no license was given and I ripped in cold blood from fellow hackers, do as you wish, use it, fork it, and send pull requests as you like and I'll include more of it here. Just remember that I only collected and did not write all of those.
Use with caution on non-fresh-installs. I warned you.
